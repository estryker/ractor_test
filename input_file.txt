This is a file in english plain text. There is nothing special about it except that 
it is in English. There should be a decent distributions of letters, assuming that I take
special care to include enough normal words. I'm not sure how to include low frequency letters
without being too obvious about it. Hopefully the use of high frequency letters will be 
sufficiently close to my model that it will just work itself out.
